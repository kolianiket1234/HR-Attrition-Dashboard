# HR Attrition Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Using Power BI)
## Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to create an HR Attrition Dashboard in Power BI to track employee turnover, find the main reasons for attrition, and provide useful insights. This dashboard will help HR teams understand trends, monitor workforce changes, and take data-driven actions to improve employee retention.

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the overall attrition rate?
- Which departments and job roles have the highest turnover?
- Are there trends in attrition based on age, gender, or experience level?
- How does salary, promotion, or performance rating impact attrition?
- What are the top reasons employees leave the company?
- How does attrition vary over time (monthly/yearly trends)?
- Is there a difference between voluntary and involuntary attrition?
- How does employee engagement or satisfaction affect attrition?
- Are there specific locations or teams with higher turnover rates?
- Can we predict future attrition based on past trends?
